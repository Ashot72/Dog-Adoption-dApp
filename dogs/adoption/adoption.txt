Candie

Double Dog Dare Rescue

Raymond K. Chen
937-795-7002

Candi is an 8-10 yr old Chihuahua. She was over bred, abused, neglected, and thrown away. We at Double Dog Dare were so happy to welcome Candi. She is doing well, has been spayed, and had a dental. She's looking for a quiet home where she can hang out and be treated w patience and kindness. Candi does very well in a small playpen with her bed, food/water, and pee pads. At only 5 lbs it's fun to see Candi as she is starting to blossom and will sometimes come out of her bed and show interest in what is happening. She has also started to howl if she wants food. She has a hearty appetite despite having only 3 front incisors. If you're looking for a tiny little treasure, Candi is your girl.

Approximately 3 month old female black lab mix. If you want a snuggle pup she is the one for you. Very sweet friendly little girl. Does well with all of my dogs and has been outgoing with all the people she has met. Does well in her crate and has had no accidents in the house for the week that i have had her. She has gone to the door when needing to go out. Does so well in the fenced yard so would be best for her to have a home with fenced yard.

Carter

Hubbards Hounds Dog Rescue

James J. Rickel
818-339-3572

Cater is a 9 year old pom who was surrendered to us through no fault of his. He is a sweet little one and might do better in a home with just his brother Cooper who he arrived with. He does okay with my other small dogs, but doesn't really interact with them at all. He is neutered and will be brought up to date with shot and HW tested this coming week. Then he will be available for adoption. He has recently been groomed and is adorable! He loves the fenced yard and I'm sure when the weather is nicer will spend a good deal of time outside. Loves to just look around.

Prima

No Hungry Pets Project

Thomas C. Watkins
541-262-5082

Prima was found roaming the streets of Rancho Viejo, the disadvantaged area of mainland Isla Mujeres. 

She had an infection on her leg and could barely walk. After some much-needed vet care and some TLC, she is all healed up with barely any signs left to her injury. 
She is gorgeous! Her picture does not do her justice. More importantly, she is SO SO sweet. And SO gentle and playful and loves life and everyone she meets. 
She also walks so well on leash, which is an added bonus!
She is available for adoption

Benjamin

Vermont English Bulldog Rescue

Dennis D. Woodford
484-782-6640

Benjamin is a two year old purebred Old English Bulldog who has experienced a lot of change in his short life. His is in great health. He is 90 pounds of Bulldog. Benjamin is compatible with female dogs only. He loves car rides and adventures. Benjamin will not tolerate being crated although if the door is left open he will sleep in it as long as he knows that you are near. Benjamin will do best in a Bulldog experienced home. He has no bite history or aggression but he is a big dog and can be typically opinionated if he does not want to do something. Benjamin loves hikes and walks in cooler weather. This is not an apartment or city dog. Although friendly with all people, Benjamin will do best in a home with older children. He is so big and unaware of his size that he could easily knock over a small child
